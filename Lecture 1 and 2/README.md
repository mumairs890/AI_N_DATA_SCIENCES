# AI_N_DATA_SCIENCES
*Exciting Journey in AI and Data Science Begins*
Peace and blessings of Allah be upon you. I am pleased to share that I have recently enrolled in an AI and Data Science course at Saylani Mass IT Training Program. Unfortunately, I missed the first class due to prior commitments while in Lahore, but I attended the second class today, and it was an outstanding experience. Our instructor, Ahmad Jajja, provided excellent guidance, making the learning environment truly exceptional.
The quality of instruction is top-notch, and Iâ€™m particularly grateful for the opportunity to learn at such a prestigious institution, which is known for its excellence across 66 diverse fields. The IT training department, where I am studying, is just one of the many areas in which this institution excels. Saylani Welfare International Trust, a large and respected welfare organization, has made this possible, and I sincerely thank them for offering free admission and providing such an excellent platform for IT education.
I pray that Allah keeps me dedicated throughout this one-year course and allows me to successfully gain the skills and knowledge I aim to master, especially in Python, which will greatly enhance my future opportunities. I ask for your prayers that Allah makes this journey easy and fruitful for me.
